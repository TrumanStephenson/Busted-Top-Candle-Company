                        We are Dale and Jennifer Burkett, the proud owners and designers behind Busted Top Candles. 
                        Our journey began in the summer of 2021 with a collection of empty wine bottles—each one holding sentimental value or boasting a unique label. 
                        Driven by a love for candles and a bit of Pinterest inspiration, we set out to repurpose these bottles into beautiful, hand-crafted candles.
                        After perfecting our craft through countless trials, we were thrilled to gift our first creations to family for Christmas. 
                        It was not long before our passion turned into a business opportunity. 
                        In February 2022, a chance conversation at one of our favorite wineries led to our first client in Amador Wine Country. 
                        They were on the lookout for high-quality, affordable candles, and our unique bottles caught their eye.
                        Fast forward to today, and Busted Top Candles proudly supplies over 13 wineries in Amador County and 1 in Mendocino County. 
                        Each candle is made from 100% soy wax, offering a clean burn for approximately 60 hours, infused with quality scents that enhance any setting.
                        Our primary focus is on wholesale partnerships with wineries, providing tasting room items that stand out. 
                        However, we also cater to individual customers who cherish a special bottle or wish to choose from our inventory of candles—each one crafted from our own collection of wine bottles.
                        Thank you for joining us on this journey. We are excited to share our candles with you and bring a bit of warmth and charm to your space.
