Client website:<br>
[Designed for Mobile Interface]<br>
This is for a candle making company. <i>Busted Top Candle Company</i>. They transforms used bottles of wine from local wineries 
<br>
and prepares them for a second life. This practice benefits the wineries with an extra income source, but also allowed
<br>
my client to began a business in candle making.
<br>

<br>
They have partnered with several wineries in the Northern California region and cultivated a steady relationship. 
<br>
This supported their growth and let them expand from 5 wineries, from when I first started working with them,
<br>
to 14 in little over a year. Hence their reason to get a website built to handle transactions more smoothely.
